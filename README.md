This project is a full-stack Netflix clone that replicates the streaming platform‚Äôs interface and functionality using [React](https://react.dev/) on the front end and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) on the backend. The front end displays movie thumbnails, trailers, and categories in a responsive layout, styled with [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and [React Icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons). [React-Redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-redux) manages state for efficient loading and user interactions, while Axios enables seamless API requests for dynamic content updates. [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is used for user authentication, storing login data securely, and supporting user sessions. The backend, built with Node.js, Express, and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) for MongoDB integration, handles user data and watchlists, with [CORS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) ensuring secure data communication. [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) streamlines development by updating the server in real time. This project provides a comprehensive learning experience in front-to-back development, state management, and user authentication.
